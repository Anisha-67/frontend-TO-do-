# frontend-TO-do-Application

The To-Do List application is a simple yet functional web app that allows users to add, manage,and remove tasks.
This project gave me  hands-on experience with HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. 
Through this project, I understood how to work with basic DOM manipulation, handle user input, and perform operations such as adding and removing items.

Functionality:
1. Add Task:
  o When a user enters a task in the input field and clicks the Add Task button, the task is added to the task list.
  o The input field  automatically gets  clear after adding the task.
2. Mark Task as Completed:
   o Allows users to mark tasks as completed by clicking the checkbox next to eachtask.
 o Visually differentiate completed tasks by adding a strikethrough style or changingthe text color.
3. Delete Task:
  o Included a delete button next to each task. When clicked, this button removes the task from the list.
4. Data Persistence:
 o Uses local storage to save the list of tasks so that the tasks remain even if the page is refreshed.
5. Error Handling:
  o If a user tries to add an empty task, show an error message prompting them to enter a task name.
